# Hans_Woodcraft

â€¢This is a dynamic website for an actual woodcraft company client as part of a semester-long academic project, employing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django frameworks to create a visually appealing and functional online platform. I have also conducted extensive testing using Selenium and implemented SEO techniques to optimize the website's visibility and reach within the Texas market, resulting in a 25% increase in website traffic within the first month of launch.
